## Words to Emoji

[Demo](https://wordstoemojis.netlify.app)


## Description

A React component that turns regular text into emoji representations based on the chosen emoji style, either Slack or Discord. It uses `useState` to manage the input sentence and selected emoji type, and `useMemo` to calculate the emojified output based on those values. The component provides an input field to enter the text, buttons to select the desired emoji style, and a textarea to display the converted text.
